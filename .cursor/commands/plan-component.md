Description: Determines whether a component is ready to be implemented and outlines a minimal implementation plan.

---

## Action Steps

1. Read COMPONENT_TRACKER.md.
2. Identify unchecked components.
3. Prefer atomic/foundational components over composites.
4. Validate architectural fit:
   - Compatible with existing patterns
   - Does not introduce new architectural primitives
   - Aligns with current code style

5. Select ONE component and provide:
   - Why it increases system leverage
   - Variant complexity estimate
   - Expected dependencies

## Output Format

### Selected Component:
### Why Now:
### Expected Variants:
### Architectural Notes:

Do NOT write code.
Do NOT scaffold.
